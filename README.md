The P2Pexample application is a multiplayer game, the purpose of which is to collect a full stack of matching images. Each player starts with a random set of images. The players can view each other's images and exchange a single image during each connection session. A custom Qt Quick user interface shows the players' images and allows the selection of a single image for exchange during the next NFC connection session. Dialog boxes are displayed at game startup and when a player meets the winning condition. After winning, the winning player's game is reset.
